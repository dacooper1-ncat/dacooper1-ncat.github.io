<h2> About me: </h2>
My name is Devon Cooper, I am a senior computer engineering student.
I come from The City of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia, Pa. I enjoy sports
watching & playing, specifically basketball. I'm also into fashion and
collecting sneakers. In my free time I enjoy community service, and overall,
I'm excited to learn more about website design and graduate in the fall!
